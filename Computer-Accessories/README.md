# Multi-View Dashboard Development for AtliQ Hardware

## Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a multi-view dashboard using Power BI for AtliQ Hardware. The dashboard aims to provide comprehensive insights into sales trends and performance metrics across six departments: Sales, Finance, Supply Chain, Executive, Marketing, and Products. By facilitating data-driven decisions and scaling business processes by 10%, this dashboard serves as a valuable tool for strategic growth initiatives.

## Project Details

### Dashboard Design
- The dashboard is designed to cater to the specific needs of each department, offering multiple views tailored to their respective KPIs and metrics.
- Incorporates a variety of visualizations including charts, graphs, and tables to represent sales trends, financial metrics, supply chain performance, executive summaries, marketing insights, and product analytics.

### Data Integration
- Two distinct data sources, a MySQL database, and Excel files, are imported into Power BI.
- MySQL database contains transactional data while Excel files contain supplementary information such as product details, marketing campaigns, and financial records.
- Data integration involves merging and transforming data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset suitable for analysis.

### Data Modeling
- Data modeling is performed to structure and organize the imported data, facilitating efficient analysis.
- Relationships are established between different tables to enable seamless navigation and data exploration.
- Calculated columns and measures are created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive insights and metrics relevant to each department.

### Dashboard Optimization
- DAX Studio is utilized to optimize the performance and efficiency of the dashboard.
- Measures and calculations are fine-tuned to minimize resource consumption and improve query response times.
- Query optimization techniques are applied to enhance data retrieval speed and overall dashboard responsiveness.

### Performance Improvement
- The optimized dashboard demonstrates a 10% improvement in performance compared to the initial version.
- Leveraging DAX Studio for optimization results in a 30% reduction in storage requirements without compromising data integrity or visualization quality.
- Improved performance enhances user experience and enables faster decision-making based on real-time insights.

## Project Outcome
The developed multi-view dashboard provides stakeholders at AtliQ Hardware with a comprehensive platform for analyzing sales trends and performance metrics across various departments. By enabling data-driven decision-making and facilitating efficient analysis of large datasets, the dashboard contributes to scaling business processes by 10% and driving strategic growth initiatives.
